IMPORTANT: I've used the porter_stemmer method from the nltk library
I've only copied the necessary files to run this method and am not using anything else from nltk as we agreed before
I've also not modified any of the files (except for changing imports to local files instead of the standard library)

for those who don't know what word stemming algorithm they is, it is a algorithm that converts a word to it's root form
i.e. ['love', 'loving', 'lovely', 'lovingly', 'loved']->['love', 'love', 'love', 'lovingli', 'love']
